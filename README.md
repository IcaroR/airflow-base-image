# Airflow Base Image
This is a simple repo I've created to make my life easier. Most of the time, when I needed the setup necessary to build Airflow, idiotic reasons made it not work correctly.
Out of pure rage and spite, I made this repo so that anyone can clone and run airflow without any setup.

This repo may or may not get updates, so don't contact me if something doesn't work for your specific purposes (it does for mine).

To run the image just run this command
```bash
docker-compose build --no-cache
